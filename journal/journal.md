# Journal

I plan to write a short summary of all my tries and (mostly) fails and (some) wins. This is mostly for looking back at all I've done in the future and keep me motivated.

As I'm a native French speaker, I'll do it in French because it's easier. Moreover, I mostly plan to write this for my future self, it should not be really interesting for others. If you're really interested, you could still translate it to your language.
