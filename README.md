# femtOS
An attempt at writting an operating system. This will take a long time and much effort, but like many before me, I'm gonna do it. 

## This repository
It will serve mostly for organizing my research first. I might include some directories for running a basic "Hello, world!" inside an emulator from a bootable partition in the future. 

## Structure
See references/ to have a look at all the references I used to work on this project. See journal/ to read my adventures (in French). See experiments to have a look at all the things I'm trying to do.
